# COVID-19-Data-Exploration-Project

Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Exploration Project!

For this project I used SQL to clean and manipulate the data to learn more about the COVID-19 Data set. I used two different data set, CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations to compare and contrast the various trends accrossed thetwo tables. Some SQL techniques I used for this project is CTE and Temp Table.

The environment that was used for this project is BigQuery.
